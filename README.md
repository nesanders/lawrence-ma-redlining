An interactive web viewer visualizing the relationship between historical redlining practices and modern environmental conditions in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

## 🗺️ Project Overview

This project overlays historical **Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC)** "redlining" maps from the 1930s with modern **Tree Canopy** and **Land Surface Temperature** data. The goal is to visualize how historical housing discrimination correlates with present-day environmental inequities, such as the "heat island" effect and lack of green space.

### Data Layers
*   **Historical Redlining:** Sourced from the [Mapping Inequality](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/) project (University of Richmond DSL).
*   **Tree Canopy:** High-resolution vegetative cover data (ArcGIS / Groundwork Lawrence).
*   **Surface Temperature:** Land Surface Temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery (ArcGIS / Groundwork Lawrence).

## 📂 Repository Structure

*   `index.html`: The main front-end code. Uses **Leaflet.js** to render the interactive map, handle layer toggling, and display the legend.
*   `lawrence_redlining.geojson`: The processed subset of redlining data specific to Lawrence, MA (generated by the Python script).
*   `prepare_data.py`: A Python utility script to fetch raw data from the Mapping Inequality API, filter it for Lawrence, and verify the health of the ArcGIS tile services.

## 🐍 Data Preparation (Python)

The `prepare_data.py` script is used to generate the local GeoJSON file required for the web viewer. It ensures that the large national dataset is trimmed down to just the area of interest to keep the web page fast.

### Usage
To regenerate the data or check connection status:

```bash
python prepare_data.py
```
